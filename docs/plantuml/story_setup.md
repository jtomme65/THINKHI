# Story Set up

Now we get to the interesting part....
Write me a tv scene with 4 characters,

- Location: Detroit Michigan, ABC Rehab Center
  A lower cost facility, its privately owned, and mostly gets court ordered treatment and gets funded by medicaid

## Cast:

- Nurse Jamie is a SMart tough 36 year old black woman from Detroit just out of Nursing School 1 year ago, She went to back to school after anther career. She got her Nursning Degree from Wayne State her first as a Nurse, Her Supervisor comes by every other week, but is based in Chicago
- Dr Gitesh Patel: Male 66 Years old, Retired Nephrologist from MAyo CLinic and took this job out of boredom after his wife died
- Stevie Boots -- 40 Year old Heroine Addict two weeks clean,with 4 weeks left in a six week program, presenting with low grade fever, and a bruise on his calf he connot explain. He is a former Financial Executive and is ashamed of his predicament and is prone to lie to cover his shame.
- The Entity: (Linda) portrayed as a Kind but older internal medicine expert, Think House MD but played by Linda Lavin at age 70, as smart as House but wayyyyyyyy nicer.....

Write me a teleplay, making up some vitals that could have been taken. It is a professional, but rushed, and possibly casual environment. The story should heve no indication of technology at all, EMR data would just be on paper.
The Entity will mostly have facial expressions as things happen, at some point Jamie will ask Linda, what?
