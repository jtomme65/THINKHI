**INT. ABC REHAB CENTER, DETROIT - EXAM ROOM - DAY**

The exam room is modest and feels well-used. Stacks of paperwork sit on a metal desk; there’s a slightly out-of-date blood pressure monitor on the counter. **NURSE JAMIE** stands next to **DR. PATEL**, both focused on **STEVIE BOOTS**, who sits uncomfortably, picking at the hem of his sleeve, clearly trying to appear unfazed.

**LINDA**, a quiet but ever-present figure, is seated just out of Stevie’s line of sight, watching attentively. Her demeanor is calm, insightful, and she seems tuned into the nuances of every reaction and interaction. She exchanges quiet looks with Jamie and Dr. Patel but never acknowledges Stevie directly.

**JAMIE**  
(Checking Stevie’s file, then looking at him)  
Alright, Stevie, I know it’s not easy, but let’s talk about how you’ve been feeling lately. Any symptoms we should know about?

**STEVIE**  
(Shrugging, looking away)  
It’s... nothing big. Just a bit tired, maybe. And my hands get kinda tingly sometimes, but I’m sure that’s just from, you know... detox.

Jamie gives Dr. Patel a sidelong look, and he nods, glancing toward Linda. Linda, ever the observer, raises an eyebrow but says nothing.

**DR. PATEL**  
(Keeping his tone light)  
And how’s your appetite been? You’re staying hydrated?

**STEVIE**  
(Sighs, defensive)  
Yeah, yeah... I eat when I can. Appetite’s... fine. Not a big deal.

Jamie looks at Dr. Patel, then glances back at Linda, who tilts her head thoughtfully. She raises a finger slightly, gesturing toward Stevie’s intake form. Jamie follows Linda’s silent direction, flipping back through Stevie’s initial records.

**JAMIE**  
(Looking at the intake form, curious)  
Stevie, you mentioned something on intake about feeling faint occasionally, especially after standing up quickly. Have you noticed that still happening?

**STEVIE**  
(Pauses, a little thrown)  
Uh... yeah, sometimes. Just figured it was all the changes. My body’s probably adjusting, right?

Linda looks to Jamie, and with a slight nod, silently suggests something. Jamie catches Linda’s unspoken cue and scans down the chart.

**JAMIE**  
(A little more probing)  
Your blood pressure was on the low side when you came in, and you noted a bit of numbness in your feet, too?

Stevie seems uncomfortable, not expecting them to catch this detail.

**STEVIE**  
(Downplaying it)  
It’s... I just thought maybe I was sitting too long or something.

Dr. Patel and Jamie exchange another look. Linda’s eyes flash with a spark of insight, as if pieces are coming together in her mind. She looks at Dr. Patel, who leans slightly toward her, listening as if she’s given him a silent suggestion.

**DR. PATEL**  
(To Jamie, with a hint of Linda’s input)  
Jamie, given his history... we should consider the possibility of something metabolic, maybe electrolyte imbalance, or... (glancing at Linda, who gives a subtle nod) even something like low potassium. Could explain some of these symptoms.

Jamie’s expression tightens with understanding. She glances toward Linda, who gives her an encouraging look, silently guiding her forward.

**JAMIE**  
(To Dr. Patel, acknowledging Linda’s unspoken suggestion)  
Could even be B12 deficiency or anemia if his diet’s been that erratic for so long. That’d track with the tingling and fatigue.

Linda gives an approving nod, a warm, almost proud smile. She remains silent, allowing Jamie and Dr. Patel to work through her silent cues.

**DR. PATEL**  
(Turning back to Stevie)  
You’ve probably worn your body down more than you realize, Stevie. Years of running on fumes—coffee, stress, maybe poor nutrition—that all adds up. It’s common in cases like this to see signs your body’s missing a few things.

Stevie’s defensiveness eases slightly as he listens, sensing no judgment.

**STEVIE**  
(Sighing)  
Guess that makes sense. I used to grab whatever food I could, didn’t think much about it.

Linda catches Jamie’s eye, conveying a gentle suggestion, and Jamie nods, turning her attention back to Stevie.

**JAMIE**  
(Supportive)  
We’re here to help catch what you might’ve missed along the way, Stevie. Dr. Patel’s right—maybe we should look at a few labs, just to see where your levels are.

Linda’s expression softens with satisfaction, watching as Jamie and Dr. Patel lead Stevie through the process she silently helped guide.

**DR. PATEL**  
(Hand on Stevie’s shoulder)  
Let’s keep things simple. Hydrate, focus on rest, and we’ll follow up with a few lab results. This might be a chance to tune up in ways you haven’t been able to before.

Stevie nods, a hint of relief showing. He’s grateful but still a bit guarded, though noticeably less tense.

As Stevie focuses on Dr. Patel’s words, Linda exchanges a warm glance with Jamie, as if to say “Good work.” Jamie gives her a subtle nod, and Linda quietly leans back, her job done for now, invisible once again to Stevie.

**FADE OUT.**
